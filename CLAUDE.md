# CLAUDE.md — StrikeVault working notes

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo. `README.md` covers setup, deployment,
env vars and the public API — this file covers the things that aren't obvious from
reading the code, and the mistakes that are easy to make in it.

## What this is

FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite options auto-trading bot for Indian index options
(Bank Nifty, Nifty 50; Sensex planned). TradingView webhooks in, Angel One SmartAPI
execution out. Jinja2 dashboard, APScheduler background jobs, session-based admin auth.

**Everything is PAPER trading unless two independent switches are both on.** Do not
change that without an explicit instruction. See "Live-trading safety" below.

## Ground rules

- **Never place, modify or cancel real orders while exploring.** `SMARTAPI_LIVE_TRADING`
  gates real execution; assume it may be on.
- **Deployment is manual and separate.** Code changes here are local. The live server is
  updated by the user's own push. Never assume a change is live, and say so when
  reporting work.
- **This is real money at stake even in paper mode** — paper results drive live decisions.
  Correctness matters more than speed.

## Architecture beyond the README

### The `origin` field is the isolation mechanism

`StrategyTrade.origin` is what keeps four separate experiments from contaminating each
other. Every query that reports on one of them must filter on it correctly.

| origin | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SIGNAL` | Real TradingView-signal trade. The only kind that touches risk locks, stats, Telegram. |
| `AI_ALT_OPENAI` / `AI_ALT_CLAUDE` | AI proposed an alternative after rejecting a signal (`app/ai/alternative_trader.py`) |
| `AI_ORIGIN_OPENAI` / `AI_ORIGIN_CLAUDE` | AI opened a position entirely on its own, no signal involved (`app/ai/originator.py`) |

Match with `LIKE 'AI_ALT_%'` / `LIKE 'AI_ORIGIN_%'`, **never** `!= 'SIGNAL'`. That exact
bug once put AI Origination trades on the AI Alternatives page.

### Three AI subsystems, deliberately independent

- `app/ai/validator.py` + `reviewer` — reviews incoming signals (APPROVE/WATCH/REJECT)
- `app/ai/alternative_trader.py` — on REJECT, may open an `AI_ALT_*` paper trade
- `app/ai/exit_shadow.py` — every 3 min, re-reviews open **`SIGNAL`** trades only.
  Observation-only: it can never close anything.
- `app/ai/originator.py` — every 5 min, opens `AI_ORIGIN_*` trades from spot momentum

### Scheduler jobs (`app/scheduler.py`)

| Job | Cadence |
|---|---|
| `trade-monitor` | 30s |
| `ai-exit-shadow-check` | 3 min |
| `ai-origination-check` | 5 min |
| `daily-square-off` | 15:15 IST cron |

## Gotchas that have caused real bugs

**SQLite does not round-trip tzinfo**, even on `DateTime(timezone=True)` columns.
`trade.entry_time` can come back offset-naive and blow up a subtraction against an
aware `utc_now()` with `can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`.
Always normalise through `to_ist()` (`app/time_utils.py`) before datetime arithmetic.

**LLMs wrap JSON in markdown fences** despite being told not to. Every JSON parse of a
provider response must go through `extract_json_object()` (`app/ai/json_utils.py`).
Failing to do this surfaces as a useless generic "Invalid AI response."

**Angel One's `/quote` family is 1 req/sec, process-wide.** `get_ltp`, `get_index_ohlc`
and `get_candles` all share `_throttle_quote_call()`. Several independent loops contend
for this budget — never add an unthrottled quote call.

**Angel One returns `open/high/low = 0` for index instruments** fairly often, even when
`close`/`ltp` are populated. `get_index_ohlc()` returns `None` rather than trusting
zeros. Handle the `None`.

**Expired F&O contracts vanish from the historical API.** `getCandleData` only serves
instruments still in the live scrip master. Once a contract expires its intraday history
is gone permanently — there is no archive. Any historical option pull is deadline-bound
by expiry.

**Index tokens are one digit apart and easy to confuse.**
Nifty 50 spot = `99926000`, Bank Nifty spot = `99926009`, both NSE. A wrong token here
produces plausible-looking but badly wrong strikes.

**`IndexPriceTick` density depends on whether a browser tab is open.** The recorder is
called both by the origination cycle (5 min) and by live-dashboard polling, throttled to
25s. So the AI's input resolution silently varies from ~3 to 100+ samples. This is a
known confound; `tick_sample_count` now records it per trade.

## The shared-FIXED-branch hazard

`monitor_open_trades` in `app/multi_strategy.py` handles **every non-V7 strategy** —
BNV5.1, BNV6, BNV7, NV1 *and* all AI trades. Its `FIXED` stop/target branch is shared.

The rule-based strategies are the ones currently making money. **Any exit-logic change
must be scoped with `trade.origin.startswith("AI_ORIGIN_")`**, the same way `STALL_EXIT`
and the AI Origination trailing stop already are. Changing the branch wholesale alters
what is working and destroys the single-variable measurement AI Origination changes
depend on.

## Exit paths (AI Origination)

All evaluated on the 30s monitor tick. `sl_mode` is per-trade (`FIXED` unless the model
returned unusable numbers, which it reliably doesn't — so `FIXED` in practice).

| Reason | Condition |
|---|---|
| `STOPLOSS` | premium ≤ stoploss (model-proposed % of entry, accepted 5–50%) |
| `TARGET` | premium ≥ target (model-proposed %) |
| `TRAIL_EXIT` | AI Origination only: after +8% activation, premium ≤ `high − entry×5%` |
| `STALL_EXIT` | AI Origination only: ≥60 min elapsed **and** \|P&L\| ≤ 5% **and** trail never armed |
| `TIME_EXIT` | ≥15:15 IST (end-of-day square-off, not a max-hold) |
| `TV_EXIT` | V7 only — unreachable for anything else |

`TRAIL_EXIT` is deliberately distinct from `STOPLOSS`: one is a rescued winner, the
other a plain loss. Folding them together makes the trailing stop unmeasurable.

TradingView `SELL_*` signals do **not** close trades for any strategy except V7 — they
record an observation via `record_exit_suggestion`.

## AI Origination config snapshot

- Entries only between **09:30 and 15:15 IST** (both hardcoded in `originator.py`)
- Expiry: nearest available, no offset, no expiry-day roll or cutoff
- Strike: nearest ATM, `round(spot / strike_interval) × strike_interval`
- Position size: **exactly 1 lot, always** (`quantity=contract.lot_size`) — capital
  deployed is therefore purely premium-dependent
- Confidence floor to act: 0.55
- Each provider gets its **own independent trade slot per index** — Claude and OpenAI can
  hold concurrent separate positions on the same index
- Paper unless the index has `ai_origination_live_trade` checked **and**
  `SMARTAPI_LIVE_TRADING` is on

### What the model actually sees at entry

Only this: index name, 45-minute lookback window, sample count, earliest price, current
price, % change, window high/low, up/down tick counts, and — best-effort, often absent —
today's session open/high/low/previous-close.

**No** candles, volume, indicators, HTF trend, option chain, OI/IV/PCR, VIX, or its own
track record. It does not know which strike or premium its decision will produce, and it
does not know it already has positions open. Diagnosed failure mode: it reads *being at
an extreme* as directional evidence ("price at session highs, therefore bullish").

## Live-trading safety (two-key pattern)

Real orders require **both**:

1. A per-entity opt-in — `StrategyConfig.live_trade` for signal strategies,
   `IndexConfig.ai_origination_live_trade` for AI Origination
2. The server-side `SMARTAPI_LIVE_TRADING` env var

`place_market_order` independently no-ops to a `"PAPER_ORDER"` id if the env var is off,
so a UI checkbox alone can never move real money. Preserve this.

## Costs

`profit_loss` is **gross** and must stay that way — historical analysis is anchored to it.
Cost lives separately in `estimated_cost` / `net_pnl`, computed by `app/trade_costs.py`
(Angel One published rates; slippage is a separate constant defaulting to 0.0 because
paper trading has none). Costs backfill on startup since they're derivable.

## Conventions

- Migrations are additive `ALTER TABLE` statements in `_ensure_columns()`
  (`app/database.py`), guarded by an inspector check. No Alembic.
- New nullable columns mean "not recorded", not a fabricated default. Backfill only when
  the value is genuinely derivable (cost, investment amount) — never invent it.
- Comments explain *why*, especially for anything non-obvious or that encodes a past bug.
  Match the existing density.
- IST display everywhere user-facing; `format_ist()` / the `ist` Jinja filter.
- Scripts live in `scripts/`, run as `python -m scripts.<name>`.

## Current state / open items

### AI Origination's entry signal does not work (30 Jul 2026)

A two-year backtest over ~37,000 five-minute bars per index found **no positive
directional edge** in the 45-minute drift rule the originator runs on — on either index,
at either horizon, in any drift band. Zero of 16 bands clear a Bonferroni threshold. Six
bands are reliably *negative*, and they cover the drift range where ~25,000 of ~37,000
bars sit, i.e. where almost every trade actually happens.

This supersedes the earlier "breakeven gross, uncompensated for costs" diagnosis. It is
not a cost problem and it is not a prompt problem. **Do not build entry gates, enriched
prompts, or setup filters on this signal without new evidence** — enriching the context
around a non-predictive input produces better-argued coin flips.

Full numbers, method and caveats: `docs/ai-origination-roadmap.md`.

### Put/call sensitivity asymmetry

ATM puts are 1.3–1.5× more sensitive than calls (Nifty λ −97 vs +64, Bank Nifty −72 vs
+56, fitted from real option candles and validated against first principles). So an
identical percentage stop is a **materially tighter index distance on a PE than a CE** —
12% on a Nifty put is ~0.11% of index movement versus ~0.18% on a call.

Nobody chose that asymmetry, and it persists under any entry rule. Worth considering
before any future risk-parameter work.

### Backtest tooling

`scripts/backtest/` (numpy-only, isolated from `app.main`'s import graph — a stray pandas
import there costs 80 MB on a 414 MB box), plus `band_significance.py`,
`calibrate_premium.py`, `backtest_baseline.py`, `backfill_candles.py`.

Two traps already fallen into once each, both documented in the roadmap: overlapping
forward windows inflate significance by ~√(window/stride), and premium *elasticity* is
not *delta* (they differ by ~200× for Nifty).

### Still unconfirmed

- Whether Nifty's spot token was corrected to `99926000` in Settings > Instruments.
- Whether the BNV6 Pine Script JSON comma bug (missing comma after `htf_confirmation`,
  trailing comma before the trend object's closing brace) was fixed on TradingView.

### Standing caution

Live-trade sample sizes remain small (tens of trades, days not weeks). Be honest about
that in any analysis; do not present a four-day result as established. The four-day
result that started this work read as "weak but real edge" and two years of data said
otherwise.
